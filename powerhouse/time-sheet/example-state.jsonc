/*
Informal definition

    Contributor reviews the time logs in the list and adds additional information where it’s missing. This includes the possibility to 
    1. add manual entries 
    2. remove entries
    3. change the entries’ sort order

    All time logs have the following information once the user is done: 
    1. Date and duration
    2. Description (text)
    3. Project(s) associated with the time log. (If more than one project is selected, the time log will be split equally among them.)
    4. Relevant professional skill(s): Software Development, Product Design, Design, Finance & Accounting, Legal, Operations, Risk, IT Support, … (If more than one skill is selected, the time log will be split equally among them.)
    5. Hourly rate, currency, and DAI exchange rate if the currency is not USD or DAI.

Expected operations
    X INIT 
    x UPDATE_NAME 
    x UPDATE_BASE_RATES //changed w/o operations from DAI --> BASE; or I can add another "meta" operation that would create new operation?  e.g., CREATE_BASE_RATE: 1. DELETE_DAI_RATES --> 2. CREATE_BASE_RATES. This "meta" operation assumes the use-mention distinction and would not use the objects but mention the keys/names. 
    x UPDATE_PROJECTS
    x UPDATE_SKILLS
    x UPDATE_QUOTE_CURRENCY
    x DELETE_BASE_RATES // changed w/o operations from DAI --> BASE
    x DELETE_PROJECTS 
    x DELETE_SKILLS
    x CREATE_ENTRIES //what are we creating; are we creating new database record or are we just updating the existing ones?
    x UPDATE_ENTRIES
    x DELETE_ENTRIES
    x SORT_ENTRIES 
    x CREATE_TOTALS
    X UPDATE_TOTALS
        Input example: [4,0,1,3,2]
